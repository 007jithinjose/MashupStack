 <p><b>Hours after Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s Twitter account was hacked and restored, Twitter said it had investigated the matter and that it appeared that the account “was not compromised due to any breach of Twitter’s systems”.</b><i>Responding to queries sent by The Indian Express, a spokesperson for the company said that Twitter had “24X7 open lines of communication with the PM’s Office”, and that “necessary steps to secure the compromised account” were taken as soon as the platform was informed about it.</i>

 		<li>“We have 24X7 open lines of communication with the PM’s Office and our teams took necessary steps to secure the compromised account as soon as we became aware of this activity. Our investigation has revealed that there are no signs of any other impacted accounts at this time,” a spokesperson for the company said.</li>
 		<li>Twitter, however, did not respond to further queries seeking to know the time at which Modi’s account was hacked and when they were informed about the same, the time taken to bring down the errant tweet, or whether the platform employs an additional level of security standards for public accounts of importance, such as those of political leaders, governments heads and others.</li>
 		<li>Meanwhile, sources at the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology said that the Indian Computer Emergency Response System (Cert-In) would launch a “full-scale investigation headed by a senior official” and will submit its report to the ministry soon.</li>
